# 📒 My Bigrams Study Notes

This repository contains notebooks based on [the second lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaCmpygFfXo&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&index=2&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy) of Andrej Karpathy's series **"Neural Networks: Zero to Hero"**. I've made some tiny modifications and added additional comments. 📝

The video covers the implementation of a bigram character-level language model, where the model predicts the next character based on and only on the previous one.
We build our first model with a probabilistic approach and the second one with our precios gradiente descent.

Instead of using a dataset of people's names, I used a dataset of municipalities in Spain, because I thought it would be more fun.

As you can see, results are mediocre (as expected) but we are starting to dign into the NLP cave.

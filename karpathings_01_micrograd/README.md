# 📒 My Micrograd Study Notes

This repository contains notebooks based on [the first lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy) of Andrej Karpathy's series **"Neural Networks: Zero to Hero"**. I've made some tiny modifications and added additional comments. 📝

The video covers the implementation of [Micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd), a compact and didactical deep learning library. Andrej's explanations are  very clear and engaging, so I highly encourage you to watch it if you're interested in learning or refreshing basic machine learning concepts. Probably one of the best tutorials I've ever followed.



## 📚 Notebooks Overview

My code is organized into three different notebooks:

### `micrograd_01`
🔹 Manual backpropagation of a simple function and a neuron.
    `00:00:00 - 01:27:05`

### `micrograd_02`
🔹 Adding more functions to our Micrograd library.
    `01:27:05 - 01:39:31`

### `micrograd_03`
🔹 Training a small neural network on a simple task.
    `01:39:31 - end`
